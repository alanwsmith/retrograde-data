# retrograde-data

Retrograde data set

## Overview

This is the dataset produced by the
[retrograde-calculator](https://github.com/alanwsmith/retrograde-calculator) 
project. Details on how it's produced
are in that repo

The data in the `current` directory used to be kept up to date
by a github action but I turned it off in case github
expands their charging to public repos
